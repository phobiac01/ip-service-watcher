# ip-service-watcher
Watcher and notifier for changes in DNS resolved IP or HTTP service status on any domain

This service requires an internet connection and the NodeJs runtime.
If you already have Node installed simply clone the repo, install the modules 'npm install', then run the index.js file 'node index.js'

Make sure to modify index.js with the domain and service options you want to watch. A customized config file or interactive CLI tool will be coming soon.

Hope you enjoy! Feel free to leave feedback, file a bug report, or fork the repo for your own uses.
